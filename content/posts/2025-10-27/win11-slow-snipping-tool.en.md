Recently, I had to switch from **Windows 10 to Windows 11** for work.
After a while, I noticed that the **Snipping Tool** was acting sluggish.

I use the tool daily to take screenshots of user interfaces and websites – often for support tickets or documentation.
The shortcut **Win + Shift + S** used to be perfect: select the screenshot, automatically copy it to the clipboard, done.

On Windows 11, it suddenly became different:
After pressing `Win + Shift + S`, it takes up to 3 seconds for the screenshot mode to start.
Not much at first glance, but in daily work, it’s extremely annoying.

### The Solution: Back to "Snip & Sketch"

The problem is that Windows 11 replaced the classic tool with the new, modernized *Snipping Tool*.
It’s prettier, can record videos, but starts much slower.
Fortunately, you can restore the old behavior:

1. Open `Start → Settings → Apps → Default Apps`
2. Search for `Snipping Tool`
3. Scroll down to `MS-SCREENCLIP`
4. Select `Snip & Sketch`

After that, the screenshot mode starts much faster, just like it did in Windows 10.

A small trick – but a real productivity boost.
