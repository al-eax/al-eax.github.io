Last christmas I bought my self an old used [Roborock S5max vacuum robot](https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-s5-max).
I got it for 65â‚¬, which is cheap since some get sold for the doubled price.
The robot comes with a mountable water tank and can also mop the floor.


After some runs I noticed that the robot leaves puddles on the ground, espacially on doorsteps.
I removed the water tank and discovered that somehow water was accumulating between the water tank and the mop.
As soon as the robot moves jerkily, it leaves a puddle behind.


After dismounting the tank I noticed that water was leaking from nozzle from the tank to the mop as this sketch shows:

1. water tank
2. water dropping from the tank on the mop
3. water dropping from the tank unter the tank <-- the problem lies here!


I did some research and found serverel threads about this problem [[2]], [[3]], [[4]].
In the Roborock user forum, the vendor suggests to put some oil around the two water nozzle to avoid leaking water [[5]].
How ever, some people claim this solution only works for a few session until the robot starts dropping puddles again.


In [[1]] some people describe how they fixed this issue by closing the gab between the nozzle and the mop, as shown in this sketch:

Therefor we need some kind of pipe which matches the size of the nozzle.
