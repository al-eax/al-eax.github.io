Welcome to my tech blog! I'm Alex, born in 91 and I discovered my passion for programming and hacking while I was still at school. 
During my computer science studies, I worked on reverse engineering and malware analysis, 
which took my understanding of software and systems to a new level. 


This blog is my hobby project and a place where I share my enthusiasm for software and hardware. 
Here you will find projects and insights into my experiments and reflections, 
which will hopefully inspire you to get creative yourself.

Have fun browsing and thinking along!
