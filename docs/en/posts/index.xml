      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my tech blog! I&amp;rsquo;m Alex, born in 91 and I discovered my passion for programming and hacking while I was still at school.
During my computer science studies, I worked on reverse engineering and malware development,
which took my understanding of software and systems to a new level.
This blog is my hobby project and a place where I share my enthusiasm for software and hardware.
Here you will find projects and insights into my experiments and reflections,
which will hopefully inspire you to get creative yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
